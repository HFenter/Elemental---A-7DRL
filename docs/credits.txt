This game was made as a Seven Day Rougelike, to test myself before the 2015 competition. In the 7DRL you have to make a complete roguelike game in just 7 seven days! 

It was made by Delvair.  He makes games and stuff.

The tileset and other graphics were made by Starr.  Aren't they pretty?

The game runs on python, and uses the libtcod library by Doryen.
The game borrows heavily from the libtcod roguelike tutorial written by Jotaf.
