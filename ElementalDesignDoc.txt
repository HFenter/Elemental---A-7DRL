Elemental

Design Goals

1. You're the Pet.  Actually you're a summoned "Elemental".
2. You're goal is to keep your mage alive.  If he dies, game over.  If you die, you get resummoned in a slightly weaker form, based on your mages current level (and perhaps a hidden mage essence tracker ?).
3. As you kill things, you gain their elemental essence ( Light, Dark, Earth, Fire, Water )
4. You can choose to absorb this essence ( or save it for later ? ) or not, thereby tweaking your overall essence. 
5. By tweaking your essence, your basically morphing yourself to one of the typical RPG roles (tank, healer, dps, etc)

x levels to a final boss level



Random Ideas

Can loose track of your mage, but you can always "sense" his general direction.
Some loot for your mage perhaps?
