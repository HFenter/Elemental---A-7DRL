Elemental

Design Goals

1. You're the Pet.  Actually you're a summoned "Elemental".
2. You're goal is to keep your mage alive.  If he dies, game over.  If you die, you get resummoned in a slightly weaker form, based on your mages current level (and perhaps a hidden mage essence tracker ?).
3. As you kill things, you gain their elemental essence ( Light, Dark, Earth, Fire, Water )
4. You can choose to absorb this essence ( or save it for later ? ) or not, thereby tweaking your overall essence. 
5. By tweaking your essence, your basically morphing yourself to one of the typical RPG roles (tank, healer, dps, etc)

Typical RougeLike random dungeon world
(10?) levels to a final boss level

(4 ?) spells per school



Random Ideas

Can loose track of your mage, but you can always "sense" his general direction.
Some loot for your mage perhaps?
